# Monitoring and evaluation of adaptation actions and process

The guiding framework for monitoring and evaluation is: 

- a. Monitoring and evaluation system (mapped to goals and objectives, and targets where applicable; 5 types of metrics: inputs, process, output, outcome, impact). Indicators for each programme/project to be identified to track outcomes. 

- b. Reporting on progress on NAPs under the UNFCCC (through National Communications/Adaptation Communications) 

- c. Link to the NDC 

- d. Reporting and outreach at the national level 

- e. Use of the PEG M&E tool9 to monitor NAP process.

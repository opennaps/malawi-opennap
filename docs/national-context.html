<p><strong>Environment:</strong> Malawi’s landscape has a varied topography and is dominated by the Great Rift Valley, which runs north to south and contains Lake Malawi and the Shire River Valley. To the west are the central plateaus, highlands (Nyika and Viphya in the north and Shire in the south) and isolated mountains (Mulanje and Zomba) (USAID, 2017a). In the mountainous sections of Malawi surrounding the Rift Valley, plateaus rise generally 800m to 1,200m above sea level, with some especially in the north rising as high as 3,000m. To the south of Lake Malawi lie the Shire Highlands, approximately 900m above sea level. The Shire River plays a very significant role in Malawi by providing water for generating hydropower (98% of Malawi’s electricity), agriculture, fisheries, transport, tourism, urban and rural water supply along its length, impacting the livelihoods of over 5.5 million people in the southern region of Malawi (Masi, 2017). Freshwater for irrigation in Malawi’s plantations such as Illovo Sugar at Nchalo is obtained from the Shire River; as well as other domestic and industrial uses (UNFCC, 2006). Malawi has multiple important waterbodies including Lake Malawi, (the third largest African Rift Valley Lake), Lakes Malombe, Lake Chilwa, and Lake Chiuta(USAID, 2015). Other rivers in Malawi providing water comprise of North and South Rukuru and Songwe in the Northern Region, Linthipe, Bua and Dwangwa in the Central Region, and Shire and Ruo in the Southern Region (Global Water Partnership, 2016).</p>
<p>In 2005, forest area coverage was at 24.3% while cultivated land covered 33.7%, shrubs and savanna woodlands covered 19.9% and the remaining 22.1% of Malawi was
covered by water. In the upper Shire River catchment, there was an 18 % increase in agricultural land in the 1989 to 2002 period (Mtilatila et al. 2020). Forests
and trees impacts livelihoods and the economy through the supply of biomass fuels, provision of habitats for wildlife and biodiversity, prevention of land
degradation, protection of watersheds and acts as sources of soil fertility (Hughes et al. 2019). Malawi has the highest deforestation rate in sub-Saharan Africa
with the government of Malawi estimating that the annual rate of deforestation in Malawi is 1.0–2.8%. Estimation shows that the ratio of forest area decreased from 51% to 33% from 1990 to 2010 (Mapulanga and Naito, 2019). Malawi has very low greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of around 1.4 tons CO2 equivalents (CO2e) per capita in 2015 by global standards (Hughes et al. 2019). According to Malawi’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), the main sectors contributing to GHG emissions are as at 2015, forestry at 78% of the emissions, agriculture at 16% and energy at 4% (Irish Aid, 2018).</p>
<p>Soil degradation is a major challenge with soil losses averaged at 20 T/ha/year. This translate in a yield loss of 4% - 25% annually (Irish Aid 2019). In 2014, the average annual national soil loss rates were estimated at 29 tons per hectare, and soil erosion and nutrient depletion are reported to affect more than 60% of Malawi’s land area. The main causes of this degradation are unsustainable farming practices, increasing demand for agricultural land and wood fuels associated with a growing population. Chemical land degradation, including soil pollution and salinization/ alkalization, has led to 15% loss in the arable land in Malawi in the last decade alone. The annual costs of land degradation between 2001 and 2009 have been estimated at USD 244 million per year-an amount equivalent to 6.8% of Malawi’s country’s GDP. Between 2008 and 2016, urban household demand for charcoal increased by 35% and was worth more than USD 66 million in 2016 and provided employment opportunities for over 235,000 people (Hughes et al. 2019).</p>
<p><strong>Climate:</strong> The majority of the country experiences a cool tropical continental climate, characterized by two distinct seasons: a rainy season from November to
April and a dry season from May to October. Annual rainfall ranges from 500 mm in low-lying areas such as the Shire Valley to above 3,000 mm in the northern
highlands. Overall rainfall exhibits high inter-annual variability and is highly influenced by the El Niño Southern Oscillation (USAID, 2017a). The rains can
start as early as October, especially in the south of the country and can end as late as May, especially in the north of the country (Malawi, 2015). The warm-wet
season stretches from November to April, during which 95% of the annual precipitation takes place. Malawi experiences large heterogeneity in rainfall regime, and
there are big differences between the North, Central and South regions. Annual average rainfall varies from 725mm to 2,500mm with Lilongwe having an average of
900mm, Blantyre 1,127mm, Mzuzu 1,289mm and Zomba 1,433mm (Masi, 2017). In the south of Malawi, the wet season normally lasts from November to February bringing
around 150‐300m per month, but rain continues into March and April in the north of the country as the ITCZ migrates northwards. Inter‐annual variability in the
wet‐season rainfall in Malawi is also strongly influenced by Indian Ocean Sea Surface Temperatures, which can vary from one year to another due to variations in
patterns of atmospheric and oceanic circulation. The most well documented cause of this variability is the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) (UNDP, n.d.).</p>
<p>Average daily temperatures vary with seasons and elevation, with the coldest temperatures (12–15°C) in July in the highlands and the hottest (25–26°C) in October
in the Lower Shire Valley (USAID 2017a). Mean annual temperature has increased by 0.9°C between 1960 and 2006, an average rate of 0.21°C per decade (Irish Aid
2018). A cool, dry winter season runs from May to August with mean daytime temperatures varying between 17 and 27°C, and temperatures falling between 4 and 10°C
at night. A hot, dry season lasts from September to October with daytime temperatures between 25 and 37°C. The wet season generally occurs between November
and April and the dry season between May and October. Average temperatures range between 18° and 27°C, and the wet season can bring average monthly rainfall in
the order of 150mm to 300mm (Masi, 2017; UNDP, n.d.). Between 1967 and 2003, the country experienced six major droughts and incidences of flooding. 2011-12
droughts had severe effects on food security in many districts in Malawi, with approximately 2 million people affected, particularly in the southern districts.
(Irish Aid, 2018). Floods in Malawi have been associated with heavy upstream rainfall resulting in too much water downstream that leads to the breaking-up of
river banks. This is a common feature on the North Rukuru in Karonga, Likangala in Zomba, and the Ruo/Shire Rivers in Chikwawa/NsanjeMalawi has also experienced
flush floods due to prolonged torrential rains, such as the Phalombe flush floods in 1991 that killed over 1,000 people, and wiped out villages, crops, livestock
and property (UNFCC, 2006). Intensive flooding in 2015 left many lives and livelihoods destroyed (Irish Aid, 2018).</p>
<p><strong>Political context:</strong> The Republic of Malawi is a sovereign State with rights and obligations under the Law of Nations (Malawi Constitution, Chapter one). There
shall be a President of the Republic who shall be Head of State and Government and the Commander-in-Chief of the Defense Forces of Malawi (Article 78). The
President shall be elected by a majority of the electorate through direct, universal and equal suffrage (Article 80(2)). The National Assembly of Malawi is the
supreme legislative body of the nation. The National Assembly has 193 Members of Parliament (MPs) who are directly elected in single-member constituencies using
the simple majority system and serve five-year terms. Malawi is a member of the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations, the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) (Malawi 2017), the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), and the African Union (AU). Malawi was a one party state since
attaining her independence until 1993 when it became a multi-party state (Masi, 2017).</p>
<p><strong>Legislative context:</strong> The GoM prioritizes climate change, natural resources, and environmental management in its development strategy, the Malawi Growth and
Development Strategy (MGDS II 2012–2016). The GoM has also invested in the Green Belt Initiative (GBI); an initiative which seeks to transform Malawi, through
irrigation, from a predominantly consuming and importing country to a producing and exporting country (USAID, 2013). In 2016, Malawi made an ambitious 4.5
million hectares restoration pledge to the Bonn Challenge and the African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative (AFR100) by 2030 estimated at a cost of
approximately 279 billion MWK or approximately 62000 MWK per hectare (USAID,2017b). GoM in partnership with the World Bank and African Development Bank has
formulated this Strategic Program for Climate Resilience (SPCR) under the Pilot Programme for Climate Resilience (PPCR) to act as a framework for addressing the
challenges of climate change that impact on the national economy and community livelihoods. The SPCR will build on the available enabling frameworks and efforts
in climate resilience-building programs as stipulated in the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy III, National Climate Change Management Policy (2016),
National Agriculture Policy (2016), National Climate Change Investment Plan (2013), and Malawi’s Nationally Determined Contribution under the UNFCCC (2015).</p>
<p>Malawi is a signatory to various international treaties, instruments and that cover climate change. These include the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol. These treaties and instruments oblige the country to take various actions to address climate challenges including
putting in place instruments such as climate change policies and legislation. Malawi is a member of the Least Developed Countries’ (LDCs) Group, the LDC Expert
Group (LEG), and currently has a seat on the board of the Adaptation Committee and the Green Climate Fund (GCF) Board (Masi, 2017). The Government has put in
place a series of legislative sectoral frameworks and strategies to integrate environment and climate change management in socio-economic development activities.
Key ones include: Vision 2020; the Malawi Growth and Development Strategies; National Environmental Policy (NEP) 2004; NAPA 2007; National Climate Change
Investment Plan (2013); Malawi Energy Policy (2003); Food Security Policy (2006); Disaster Preparedness and Relief Act (DPRA) (1991); Environment Management Act
(1996) and the Disaster Risk Management Policy 2015 (Irish Aid, 2018).</p>
<p><strong>Social context:</strong> According to the World Population review, January 2018, Malawi has a land area of 118,484 square kilometers, with an estimated population of
18,921,352 million which ranks 61st in the world. Malawi still has a fairly low population density of 129 people per square kilometer (86th in the world).
However, Malawi is growing rapidly with a 3.06% (Masi, 2017) annual growth rate. High incidences of poverty, violence, unemployment, malnutrition, HIV and AIDS,
high illiteracy rates, abuse, poor health, and psychological disorders characterize the country’s young population (MDGS II 2011-2016) (Irish Aid, 2018). About
85% of the people live in rural areas and derive their livelihoods from natural resources and agriculture (from small land holdings of between 1.0 and 5.0 ha per
household of five people), with the remaining 15% residing in urban areas. About 48% of the population is below 15 years of age. The overall average life
expectancy as of 2008 statistics was 37 years with fertility rates declining from 7.6 in 1984 to 2.8% in 2008 and later rising to 6.7 (Malawi Vision 2020). There
has been migration from rural to urban areas (at the rate of 3.6% per year), and from densely populated to sparsely populated areas or districts over the decades
from areas adversely affected by climatic hazards (especially floods and drought) to safer upland areas or other districts (Ministry of Environment and Climate
Change Management Environmental Affairs Department, 2018) and in search of income earning opportunities (Malawi Vision 2020). 33150 cases and 981 deaths were
recorded in Malawi’s worst Cholera outbreak. Waterborne infectious diseases are a leading cause of child mortality and contribute to forms of growth retardation,
including stunting and wasting with 48 to 53 percent of children under the age of five suffering from stunted growth (Republic of Malawi, 2012). Overall, records
as to disaster damage provided by Department of Disaster Management Affairs, DoDMA and the Prevention Web (by The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk
Reduction, UNISDR) give critical information related to human and economic losses resulting from the disasters that have occurred in Malawi within last three
decades. More than 47 natural disasters were recorded in the last three decades and these disasters range from droughts, earthquakes, epidemics, floods and
storms. In these natural disasters, a total of 2,775 people were killed with an average of 90 people killed per year. Most of these (60%) died due to epidemics
(National Water Resources Masterplan- Part II masterplan). Malaria is the most common disease in the lake areas, followed by respiratory infections, diarrhea,
anemia, and bilharzia/schistosomiasis. HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are also common. Research conducted by Madsen et al. between
1998 and 2007 found a high prevalence of schistosomiasis in communities living along the shores of Lake Malawi. They found that the prevalence of urinary
schistosomiasis ranged from 10.2% to 26.4% in inland villages and from 21.0% to 72.7% in lakeshore villages. Infection rates were higher among school age
children ranging from 15.3% to 57.1% in inland schools and from 56.2% to 94.0% in lakeshore schools. The HIV infection rate in Malawi as a whole was 10.3% in
2010 (UNAIDS) (USAID, 2015).</p>
<p><strong>Economic context:</strong> Agriculture is central to Malawi’s economy, contributing nearly 40 percent of GDP and roughly 90 percent of the country’s export earnings
(USAID, 2017a). Maize is a dominant crop in Malawi, accounting for 28.8 percent of agricultural GDP. Groundnut is an important smallholder food and cash crop in
Malawi contributing 1.6 percent to agricultural GDP. Soya and sunflower account for 13 percent of that sector’s total intermediate input expenditure, and account
for 1.9 percent of agricultural GDP (Aragie et al. 2018). The agriculture sector is the driver of Malawi’s economy and provides employment to 85% of the
workforce, and contributes 85 to 90% of foreign exchange earnings and 60 to 70% of raw materials for the manufacturing sector (UNFCCC, 2006). Over half (51%) of
Malawi’s predominantly rural (86%) population live below the national poverty line, most (85%) dependent on agriculture for livelihood, and on only $320 United
States Dollars (USD) per capita per year (Chinsinga, Chasukwa and Naess 2012; World Bank 2014; Zulu 2017). Average annual headline inflation in 2016 stood at
22.6%, slightly lower than the 2015 figure of 21.0%, with rising food inflation as the main driver. Power generation reduced by 30% due to low levels in the
Shire River affecting economic activities in sectors such as manufacturing, which experienced low capacity utilization. Malawi’s overall GDP grew at only 2.7% in
2016, down from 2.9% in 2015. According to the poverty statistics for 2010, 70.9% of the people in Malawi are living on less than $1.90 a day. The people living
below the national poverty line are 50.7% and the country inequality trend (GINI Index) stands at 46.1 (Irish Aid 2018). According to the United Nations
Development Program’s Human Development Report for 2014, about 62% of the population in Malawi lives on less than US $1.25 a day and 89% lives below the US $2 a
day threshold (USAID, 2015). Tobacco is Malawi’s largest export cash crop, accounting for over half of export earnings, followed by tea and sugar (Purchase from
Africans for Africa. n.d.; FAO, n.d.; and World Bank, 2012). Fishing contributes about 4% to Malawi’s Domestic Product (GDP) and accounts for 60–70 percent of
Malawians’ animal protein intake. An estimated 1.6 million Malawians derive at least some income from fishing, fish processing, marketing and trading, boat and
gear-making, and allied industries (Brummet and Noble, 1995; Andrew et al. 2003). Wildlife is a valuable tourism resource as it can contribute significantly to
incomes and employment. The sector, however, faces a number of challenges including poaching, poor supporting infrastructure, and low community participation in
wildlife conservation (USAID, 2013).</p>
<p>Malawi is one of the poorest countries in the world, ranked 170 of 188 countries on the global United Nations Development Programme’s HDI. More than 70% of the
population lives below the international poverty line of USD 1.90 per capita per day and GDP per capita is just USD 372 (2015). Both inequality and poverty rates
are high. About 20.7% of the people are so poor that they cannot afford to eat a minimum daily recommended food intake, and at least 37% of children under five
are chronically undernourished and stunted (low weight for age). Malawi’s wealth per capita, USD 8,409 in 2014, is much lower than the average for other low-
income countries (USD 13,629) or for Sub-Saharan Africa as a whole (USD 25,562) (Hughes et al. 2019). Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 5.7% in 2014, but
slowed down to 2.5% in 2016 after floods in early 2015 followed by two consecutive years of drought, which has adversely affected the performance of agriculture,
which accounts for about a third of the country’s GDP. The country has a GDP of US$ 6.4 billion (2015 data), and per capita income (2015 data) is US$ 34011.
Malawi is a low-income country with 74% of Malawians earning US$ 1.25 per day or less. Using national poverty headcount, approximately 50.7% of the population
live below the national poverty line. About 24.5% are considered ultra-poor, meaning that they cannot afford to meet the minimum standard of the daily
recommended food requirement. Levels of chronic malnutrition are very high at 42%, wasting is at 4% and underweight prevalence is at 13%. The 2015 flood damage
cost event estimated at US$ 335 million, equivalent to approximately 5% of GDP. Land degradation is estimated to cost the equivalent of 5.3% of GDP each year
with soil degradation a significant factor that contributes between 4 and 25% to the loss of agricultural yields in Malawi (Masi, 2017).</p>
<p>Lake Malawi provides the main source of the country’s fish production. Other important sources include Lake Chilwa, Lake Malombe and the Elephant Marsh. The
sector has experienced considerable decline of commercially important fish species like Chambo (Oreochromis spp.) from around 30,000 Mt a year in the late 20th
century to about 2,000 Mt annually in recent years from Lake Malawi caused by overfishing and climatic influences which result in reduced water levels and
disrupt fish breeding and nursery sites. Weak governance capacity to enforce fisheries regulations, and control of illegal fishing and destruction of habitats,
contribute to reduced abundance of fish stocks and fisheries resources in Malawi (Masi, 2017). The National Human Development Report of 2001 ranks Malawi as one
of the lowest in terms of Human Development Index (HDI), placing it at number 163 out of 173 countries in the world (United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP)/Malawi Government (MG), 2001). It is one of the poorest countries in Africa, with about 65% of its population living below the poverty line in 1998, and
29% living in extreme poverty (MG, 1995, 2000; MoA, 2005; UNFCCC 2006). The manufacturing sector currently makes a small contribution to national income (12% of
GDP) and employment and there is limited industrial diversification. In addition, there are weak inter and intra-industry linkages (Malawi Vision 2020).</p>
<p><strong>Technological context:</strong> It is the aspirations of Malawians through their Malawi’s Vision 2020 to have a science and technology-driven economy. A developing
country such as Malawi needs information technology to achieve development in all spheres of human endeavor. However, promoting the use of IT is the main
challenge (Malawi Vision 2020). Greater use of geospatial technologies such as aerial surveys, satellite monitoring, and drone surveys could help address the
limited human resources at field levels. Mobile phone technologies are rapidly improving communication and services with growing opportunities for informing
Malawians on environmental issues (Hughes et al. 2019). The media plays a key role in raising public awareness on climate change issues especially in informing
rural communities who suffer most due to adverse impacts of climate change due to their low adaptive capacity (Ministry of Environment and Climate Change
Management Environmental Affairs Department, 2013-2018). The systematic use of new cell phone technologies, social media, video documentaries, radio and TV
programs, and other information-communication technologies can greatly accelerate the widespread knowledge of proven restoration interventions (Ministry of
Natural Resources, Energy and Mining, n.d.).</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.1</span> Legal frameworks</h3>
<p>The vision of Malawi’s NAP aligns with the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy III (2017-2022). MGDS III is anchored in Water Development, Agriculture and
Climate Change. The NAP process will address climate change management through improved community resilience to climate change through enhanced agricultural
production, infrastructure development and disaster risk management. The MGDS III adaptation strategies for Agriculture, Water Development and Climate Change
Management include increased agricultural production and productivity, increased land under irrigation; increased agricultural diversification, enhanced
agricultural risk management, enhanced integrated water resources management at all levels, and improved weather and climate monitoring for early warning,
preparedness and timely response. These will be the strategies the NAP will also prioritize. The MGDS III goals are premised on Malawi’s long term development
aspirations well laid out in Vision 2020.Malawi has also prioritized climate change, environment and natural resources management among the priorities within
priorities of the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS II). Government of Malawi has also developed the National Climate Change Management Policy (NCCMP)
whose goal is to promote climate change adaptation, mitigation, technology transfer and capacity building for sustainable livelihoods through Green Economy
measures for Malawi. The policy outlines six priority areas for climate change management in the country which include: Climate change adaptation, Climate change
mitigation, Capacity building, education, training and awareness, Research, technology development and transfer, and systematic observation, Climate change
financing, Cross-cutting issues like gender consideration, population dynamics and HIV and AIDS.</p>
<p>The NCCMP policy statements are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Reduce vulnerabilities of populations in Malawi and promote community and ecosystem resilience to the impacts of climate change;</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that women, girls and other vulnerable groups are engaged and involved in planning and implementing climate change adaptation interventions; and</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that communities are able to adapt to climate change by promoting climate change adaptive development in the long term.</p></li>
<li><p>Promote the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions; and</p></li>
<li><p>Enhance carbon sinks through re-afforestation and sustainable utilization of forest resources.</p></li>
<li><p>Build capacity in all sectors and at all levels in climate change to attain socio-economic development utilizing the principles of green economy; and</p></li>
<li><p>Address capacity gaps on investment in skills and capabilities for negotiations, mechanisms for reducing emissions while supporting prudent environmental
management and sustainable economic growth.</p></li>
<li><p>Enhance research, technology and systematic observation for climate change management, supported by appropriate capacity development and dedicated financing</p></li>
<li><p>Encourage resource mobilization and commitment of government for the prioritized technologies.</p></li>
<li><p>Enhanced financing for implementation and coordination of climate change management activities through increased national budgetary allocation, establishment
of a Climate Change Management Fund, improved access to international climate financing (both multilateral and bilateral) and private sector investments.</p></li>
<li><p>Mainstream gender and issues affecting the disadvantaged groups into all climate change strategies, plans and programmes.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrate population issues into climate change management in the development agenda through an integrated approach which would reduce poverty, protect
natural resources and reduce inequality.</p></li>
<li><p>Incorporate HIV and AIDS as well as gender considerations in all climate change interventions including adaptation, mitigation, capacity building and
technology development and transfer.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Government of Malawi through their Vision 2020 and the Malawi Constitution 1995 has put in place a series of legislative sectoral frameworks and strategies
to integrate environment and climate change management in socio-economic development activities. These include:</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.2</span> Institutional arrangements for climate change adaptation</h3>
<p>Malawi has several existing institutional structures to support climate change mitigation and adaptation policies (Malawi &amp; Environmental Affairs Department,
2016). The Malawi Constitution explicitly calls for environmental support, and the Malawi government has addressed climate change at the national, ministerial
and departmental level (Amadu et al., 2020). Coordination between government agencies is a significant challenge for implementing the climate change policy
components since climate change is a cross-cutting issue affecting most sectors, such as agriculture, human health, energy, fisheries, wildlife, water, forestry
and gender (Hughes et al., 2019). Table 3 presents the evolution of the climate change agenda.</p>
